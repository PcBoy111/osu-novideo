# osu!novideo
This **Python 3.5** script is designed to remove all video files from your `osu!/Songs` directory.
It specifically made for videos, although it will work with any extension.

## Version
osu!novideo **only supports Python 3.5**

## Installing
The easiest way to install is to [download as ZIP][zip]. Since this script is not designed to be run as a
packaged python script, you will need to download and run it from some directory. You could put it in your 
`osu!/Songs` directory if you so wanted.

## Running
osu!novideo can be ran by simply running the python file.
```bash
python osu!novideo.py -h
```
`-h` or `--help` will show all script parameters. Running with no parameters **performs deletion in the current
directory.**
